-- You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
-- Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
-- Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

SELECT DISTINCT F1.X, F1.Y
FROM Functions F1 JOIN Functions F2 ON F1.Y = F2.X AND F1.X = F2.Y
WHERE F1.X < F1.Y OR F1.X IN (SELECT X FROM Functions WHERE X = Y GROUP BY X,Y HAVING Count(*)> 1)
ORDER BY F1.X
