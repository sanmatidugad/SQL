-- Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.
-- Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. 
-- Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power.
-- If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.
